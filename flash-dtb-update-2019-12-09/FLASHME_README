This tarball contains the system partitions needed to enable
/dev/spidev0.0 and /dev/spidev0.1.

To install it, run `sudo ./flashme.sh /dev/mmcblk0`
Reboot and you should have the spidev0.0 and spidev0.1 devices.

This program doesn't touch any other partitions or files so it's safe to run
on an existing customized filesystem.
